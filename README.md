Hello! My name is Alexander Ferrena - you can call me Alex for short. I like Biology and am trying to learn more about these glowing rocks sometimes referred to as computers. I am 23 years old and I listen to vaporwave music. I have two plants.

There was a Greek philosopher from the island of Siciliy named Empedocles who came up with the idea of the four "elements", water, earth, fire, and air. He additionally came up with two forces by which the forces interact, "love" and "strife". Different objects are made by different combinations of the material elements and different amounts of these forces. In addition to a philosopher, Empedocles was also a failed politician and a bit of an eccentric - he declared himself a god, and to test his immortality, he leapt into the volcano Mt. Etna. It didn't end well for him. Here is a photo of Mt. Etna:
